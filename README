== Preschool CMS

Preschool CMS is a simple rails web application that allows you to create a simple web presence for a Preschool website. It was created for Therfield Village Preschool, Royston, with the following principles

* _Robust_. With BDD methodology applied and 100% rspec coverage
* _Pretty_. A lot of preschool websites are not pretty. The basic site should be attractive
* _Easy to edit_. The administrator interface is embedded within the web application meaning no separate complex administrator interface

As the Therfield site grows features will be added. Currently it is a very simple, but functional, Rails application that allows you to edit news
